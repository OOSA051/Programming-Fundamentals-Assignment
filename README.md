# Programming-Fundamentals-Assignment
The focus of the Programming Fundamentals project is to illustrate the use of theory and logic in the role of web development. Using the parts and pieces of code we are able to apply theoretical aspects of code in practice. The focus is coming to understand the logical use of code for development and being about to use critical thinking to apply code to achieve a desired outcome. Plan out the program logic (business logic) for simple program  Use plan to develop a simple JavaScript program, while being assisted in class.  Plan out the program logic (business logic) for another simple program  Use plan to develop the second simple JavaScript program unassisted in class.  Optionally attempt to make the two different programs to work together into a larger program.
